# Loan-Approval-Prediction

This repository contains code for a loan approval prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not.

# 1. Install and Load Required Modules

Before running the code, make sure to install and load the necessary R packages. Required modules include "tidyverse", "dplyr", "tidyr", "caret", and "tm". You can install them using the install.packages() function in R and load them using the library() function.

# 2. Dataset Loading

The dataset used in this project is a loan approval prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle.com. It consists of 4269 observations and 13 columns. The dataset contains various features such as income, credit score, employment status, loan amount, etc.

# 3. Data Cleaning

Before analysis, the dataset undergoes data cleaning procedures to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency in the data. Data cleaning helps prepare the dataset for further exploration and analysis.

# 4. Data Exploration and Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset. This includes summarizing the data, visualizing distributions, analyzing relationships between variables, and identifying patterns or trends.

# 5. Machine Learning Method Selection and Model Training

Various machine learning methods are considered for building the loan approval prediction model. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, etc.) and training the model using the cleaned dataset.

# 6. Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

# 7. Model Improvement/Optimization

To improve the model's performance, techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and cross-validation may be employed. These steps help optimize the model for better predictions and generalization.
